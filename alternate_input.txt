Dear Students

We will be commencing our online learning model effective tomorrow at 10.00am.

This means you will not be required to come to the school and will commence your learning from home.

Given the preparation over the last week with your Mentors and teachers I am confident that we are well placed to ensure your continued learning and development from home.

I would like to advise the importance of your compliance with our Agreed Standards for Student Use of Technology available in student diaries or App4 students.

I ask that during this period of online learning you demonstrate the utmost respect and courtesy towards your classmates and your teachers at all times.

Please note, our usual start time of 8.30am will apply from Wednesday onwards.

Yours sincerely

Principal
